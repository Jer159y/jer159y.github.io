I am an integrated M.S.-Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematical Sciences at UNIST. My research interests lie primarily in nonlinear dynamics, with a focus on `reservoir computing` and `signal processing.`

Recently, I have been particularly interested in reservoir computing based on `spiking neural networks`. I am also exploring the integration of hardware- or on-chip-based system simulations with existing computational frameworks. Through this, I aim to investigate how such implementations differ from traditional `mathematical modeling`.
